## 🧰 Components Used

- **🔌 Arduino Uno**: The brain of our radar system, controlling the servo motor and ultrasonic sensor.
- **🔄 Servo Motor**: Allows the ultrasonic sensor to rotate and scan the surroundings.
- **📡 Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**: Measures the distance to objects by sending out sound waves and timing their return.
- **🔗 Jumper Wires**: Connect the components securely on the breadboard.
- **🔋 Breadboard**: A platform to build the circuit without soldering.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- **📈 Rotating Scan**: The servo motor rotates the ultrasonic sensor, allowing it to scan a wide area.
- **📏 Distance Measurement**: The sensor sends out sound waves; when these waves hit an object, they bounce back. The sensor then calculates the time taken for the sound to return and converts it into distance.
- **🖥️ Visual Display**: The data collected by the sensor is sent to a connected display (e.g., a computer) that shows a radar-like interface, visualizing the position of detected objects.
